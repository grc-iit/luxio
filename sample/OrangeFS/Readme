There are a few things to consider before running with the scripts:
	First, the config files point to personal folders for storage of data, metada and the PFS log file. Those need to be changed inside the conf/ folder
	Second, the scripts mount the PFS on top of two fodler, client_dir and server_dir. Both currently pointing to personal fodlers that shoudl be changed. Server_dir should point to the same fodler as the data fodler in step one.
		2.b) Also change the path on the provided pvfs2_tab file.
	Third, the variables ORANGEFS_KO, ORANGEFS_PATH and PVFS2TAB_FILE need to be set up, pointing to the kernel module fodler, the bin folder of orangefs and the pvfs2tab file of this particular run respectively. 
	Four, if not using ares-stor-[01-04], you might have to change the config files and the pvfs2_tab to reflect the new servers
