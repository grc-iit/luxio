# Data

This part of the repository contains pointers to the data from the Argonne and OrangeFS usecases as specified in the paper. Not all data could be contained in this repository due to size constraints, so most of it is held in a Google Drive. Also, please see resources/traces for Darshan traces, resources/job_specs for examples of jobspecs (converted to json), and resources/resource_graphs for examples of resource graphs (converted to json). In this directory we simply have the datasets for the SSLOs (sslo_classes.csv) and I/O behavior classes (unscaled_class_all.parquet).
